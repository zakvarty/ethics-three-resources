## Welcome!

<br>

### This Session: 

<br>

1. Review of Reproducibility and Robustness (15 mins)

2. Group Discussion (20 mins)

3. Group Feedback (20 mins)


# Review of Reproducibility and Robustness

## Reproducibility and Robustness - Concepts

:::{.fragment}
### Reproducibility 

Can you recreate the results of your analysis in a different setting? 

- _Reproduction:_ Can you create the same results from your data?
- _Replication:_ Do your findings generalise beyond this data?

:::

:::{.fragment}
### Robustness 

Are your results stable? 

- _Statistical aspects:_ stability with respect to violated assumptions, different samples from the same distribution, moderate differences in prior beliefs, ...
- _Computational aspects:_ stability with respect to different starting points, random seeds, bad inputs, malicious inputs.

## Reproducibility and Robustness - Workflows and Tools

:::{.column width="60%"}
:::{.fragment}
### Workflows

- Waterfall vs Agile
- MVP, CI and CD
- Difficulties from lack of modularity

### Tools

- Notebook < Script < Pipeline < Config 
- MLFlow, Kedro and friends for tracking experiments.

## Reproducibility and Robustness - Determinism and Stability

<br>

> _Determinism:_ Does the same inputs imply the same outputs? 
> 
> _Stability:_ Does $x + \delta$ imply $y + \epsilon$?
>
> **Neither concept is stronger than the other.**

. . .

```{r}
countdown::countdown(1.5)
```

**Task:** Can you think of examples where:

1. Determinism $\;\not\!\!\!\implies$ Stability 
  
2. Stability $\;\not\!\!\!\implies$ Determinism

. . . 

- High leverage points, Simulated annealing and other Monte Carlo Methods


## Reproducibility and Robustness - In Production 

:::{.fragment}
### Computational Worries 

:::{.incremental}
- _Input stability:_ Failing gracefully and defending against malicious inputs.
- _Computing environment:_ Differences in hardware, architecture, OS, language, packages.
- _Scaling:_ distributed computing requires careful handling (parallel or federated).
:::

:::{.fragment}
### Statistical Worries

Largest concerns are usually related to changes in distribution. These come in many forms: 

:::{.incremental}
- _Sample to population:_ Shadow deployment and AB testing
- _Data drift:_ Change in marginal distributions $\pi(x)$ or $\pi(y)$ 
- _Concept drift:_ Change in conditional distribution $\pi(y|x)$ or copula.

# Group Discussion 

## Task: Contextual Application

<br>

In breakout rooms, discuss the main concerns you would have with the following data science projects with regard to reproducibility and stability. 

. . . 

<br>

_Reproducibility, Robustness, Workflows, Determinism, Stability, Productionizing_

<br>

. . .

1. Hierarchical prediction of student grades in districts, schools and classes.
2. Real-time detection of fraudulent bank transactions.
3. Customer segmentation for playlist recommendations.
4. Forecasting call volumes to determine ambulance staffing levels. 
 
# Group Feedback
